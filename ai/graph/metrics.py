"""Lightweight no-op metrics hooks.

This module intentionally contains **no external dependencies** and exports
asynchronous functions that can be monkey-patched by a metrics backend at
runtime.  The default implementation is a best-effort no-op so that imports
are cheap and do not impact critical path execution.

Public API (stable):
    async graph_active(session_id: str, active: bool) -> None
    async node_latency(node: str, latency_ms: float) -> None
    async queue_depth(depth: int) -> None

These coroutines MUST NOT raise â€“ any exception will be swallowed by callers.
